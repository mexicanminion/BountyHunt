About Bounty Hunt
(This pluging is still in development. If you find any issue please report it!!! Thank you!) This plugin allows you to use a Bounty system on your server using diamonds! You dont need another pluging installed, this is a standalone plugin. The player can set a bounty on another player and the one who kills them will receive their payment. No need for a middle man.
